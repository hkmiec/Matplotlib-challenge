One observation to note is that the placebo group appears to have the fourth highest mean tumor value (54.033581), which may say something about really effective the drug was in relation to tumor development.
The line plot of Capomulin treatment of mouse l509 appears to indicate that the tumor volume decreases when given enough time as show by the rise until 20 days and then the sudden drop afterwards where the height remains lower for the rest of the plot, despite initial increases in tumor volume at the start.
The scatterplot for Mouse Weight Versus Average Tumor Volume indicates a decently strong positive correlation (r = 0.84) in the relationship between Average Tumor Volume and Weight, so larger weight may be a good indicator of a more sizable tumor volume
